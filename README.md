PubNub makes it easy to create real-time auctions with tons of features.

This demo features real-time bidding, presence, alerts, and more! PubNub handles the infrastructure of powering these features, so you can focus on building your app.

This Real-Time Auction App / Marketplace Demo utilizes PubNub for all back-end functionality and has no additional back-end servers or infrastructure. All of the primary features come from the front-end and PubNub's Pub/Sub APIs. This demo also uses [Auth0](https://auth0.com) to authenticate and manage users.
